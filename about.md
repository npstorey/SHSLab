### <a id="DSS"></a>About Department of Social Services

The Department of Social Services (DSS) is comprised of the administrative units of the New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA) and the Department of Homeless Services (DHS). HRA is dedicated to fighting poverty and income inequality by providing New Yorkers in need with essential benefits such as Food Assistance and Emergency Rental Assistance.

### <a id="DHS"></a>About Department of Homeless Services

Governed by a unique right to shelter mandate, New York City provides temporary emergency shelter to every man, woman, and child who is eligible for services, every night. New York City’s shelter system is consistently recognized as the most sophisticated and comprehensive in the nation. The City is also an innovative leader in the field of preventive services for those who are at risk of becoming homeless. The Department of Homeless Services (nyc.gov/dhs) works with partners to prevent homelessness when possible; to provide temporary, emergency shelter when needed; and to help individuals and families transition rapidly into permanent housing. We do this through providing coordinated, compassionate, high-quality services and supports.
